                Selecting the correct court or tribunal is crucial for your legal matter. Each venue has specific 
                jurisdiction, procedures, and requirements. Here's how to determine where to file:
              </p>
              
              <h3>Consider These Factors:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Type of Legal Issue:</strong> Different courts handle different types of cases</li>
                <li><strong>Monetary Amount:</strong> Small claims courts have monetary limits</li>
                <li><strong>Geographic Location:</strong> File in the jurisdiction where the issue occurred or parties reside</li>
                <li><strong>Urgency:</strong> Some venues have faster timelines than others</li>
                <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> More complex matters may require superior court</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Not Sure Where to Start?</h3>
              <p>
                Use our tribunal locator and triage tools to help determine the best venue for your specific situation. 
                We'll guide you through a series of questions to identify the appropriate court or tribunal.

                While procedures vary by venue, most courts and tribunals follow a similar general process:
              </p>
              
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Filing:</strong> Submit your application or claim with required documents and fees</li>
                <li><strong>Service:</strong> Deliver copies of your documents to other parties</li>
                <li><strong>Response:</strong> Other parties have time to respond to your claim</li>
                <li><strong>Disclosure:</strong> Exchange relevant documents and evidence</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-Hearing:</strong> May include mediation, settlement conferences, or case management</li>
                <li><strong>Hearing:</strong> Present your case before a judge, adjudicator, or panel</li>
                <li><strong>Decision:</strong> Receive a written decision or order</li>
                <li><strong>Enforcement:</strong> If needed, take steps to enforce the decision</li>
              </ol>
